1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So, overall we gone through the exoblayer internals, based on the internals we decide to preload

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
operations that we should do towards you or that means that we appear to some code and

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
we also experience some exoblayer implementation.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Exoblaying with no preloading, exoblaying, exoblaying, exoblaying is with preload manager.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And I think we also gone through the perpetrators' cases on this implementation as well.
