1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So overall we gone through the ExoPlayer internals, based on the internals we decide the preload operations that we should do to achieve the happiness data.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Then we look into some code and we also experience some ExoPlayer implementation.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
ExoPlayer with no preloading, ExoPlayer playlist, ExoPlayer playlist with preload manager.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And at the end we also gone through the perpetual traces of all this implementation as well.
